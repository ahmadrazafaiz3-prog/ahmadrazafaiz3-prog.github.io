# Welcome to My Engineering Journey

Welcome to my personal portfolio blog website. I am a Computer Engineering student at UET Faisalabad. This website serves as my digital footprint where I document my academic journey, learning experiences, projects, and lessons learned throughout my university life. The idea of creating this blog was inspired by my professor, Dr. Bilal Ahmad, who encouraged students to maintain a professional online presence and continuously share their learning experiences.

This website documents my learning journey, projects, database systems experience, and university life.

I created this portfolio blog following the advice of Dr. Bilal Ahmad to build a professional digital footprint.
